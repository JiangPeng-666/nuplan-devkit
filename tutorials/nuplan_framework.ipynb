    "## What is nuPlan\n",
    "\n",
    "nuPlan is the world’s first closed-loop ML-based planning benchmark for autonomous driving.\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides a high quality dataset with 1500h of human driving data from 4 cities across the US and Asia with widely varying traffic patterns (Boston, Pittsburgh, Las Vegas and Singapore). In addition, it provides a closed-loop simulation framework with reactive agents, a training platform as well as a large set of both general and scenario-specific planning metrics.\n",

    "* create a simulation pipeline to evaluate a planner on large dataset with various scenarios\n",
    "* score planner performance with common and scenario-dependent metrics\n",
    "* compare planners based on measured metrics and provide intuitive visualizations\n",

    "## Scenarios in nuPlan\n",
    "\n",
    "nuPlan aims to capture challenging yet representative scenarios from real-world encounters. This enables the benchmarking of planning systems both in expert imitation (open-loop) and reactive planning (closed-loop) settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "These scenarios includes:\n",
    "* highly interactive scenes with traffic participants (e.g. tailgating, high-velocity overtakes, double parked cars, jaywalking)\n",
    "* various ego behaviors (e.g. vehicle following, yielding, lane merging) and dynamics (e.g. mixed speed profiles, abrupt braking, speed bumps, high jerk maneuvers)\n",
    "* scene layouts of varied complexity (e.g. pudos, traffic/stop controlled intersections, unprotected turns) and temporary zones (e.g. construction areas)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is automatically tagged with scenario labels based on certain primitive attributes.\n",
    "These scenario tags can then be used to extract representative metrics for the planner's evaluation.\n",
    "\n",

    "In the following section we will train an ML planning policy with the aim estimate the ego's future trajectory and control the vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The policy is learned through imitation learning, a supervised learning approach in which - in the context of autonomous driving - the behavior of an expert human driver is used as a target signal to supervise the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model features & targets\n",
    "A planning policy consumes a set of episodic observations and encodes them through a deep neural network to regress a future trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The observations can be historic or present ego and agent poses as well as static/dynamic map information across different map layers.<br />\n",
    "These signals can be encoded through various representations, such as raster or vector format for the map signal, each with their pros and cons for each model flavor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these input features the model predicts a discretized future trajectory across a fixed time horizon.<br />\n",
    "The trajectory consists of a set of discrete future states (position, heading and velocity) sampled at fixed intervals which express the likelihood of the vehicle being at that state in the future.<br />\n",
    "For example, a predicted trajectory may consist of 10 future poses sampled at intervals of 0.5s across a 5s horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "The policy is trained to maximize a set of aggregated objectives such as imitation, collision avoidance, traffic rule violation etc.<br />\n",
    "Imitation is the core training objective which indicates how close the predicted trajectory is to the expert ground truth and penalizes model predictions that deviate in space and time from the demonstration."
